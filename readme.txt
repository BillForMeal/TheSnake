This project is our implementation of the classic Snake game using Java and JavaFX. 
It includes an options menu where a player may select various speeds and map sizes to adjust difficulty. 
It also includes a fully functional leaderboard which records a high-scorer's name, score, and the date of their achievement.
In the game itself, players navigate their snake with W-A-S-D or the arrow keys. The game may be paused and/or exited at any time.
Upon exit the player may enter their name if they have made the leaderboard.
We also hid an easter egg. (Check for GameController.java if you can't figure out.)

Instructions to compile and execute:

For Windows, just download and run the jar file. 

To run the project from the command line, 
go to the dist folder and
